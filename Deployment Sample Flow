project where to run two managed nodes and 1 control node on aws ec2 with password less authentication. 1 managed node should be my app server and other is db server. Write a playbook to install and run a 5 variable database on db server.
Step-1: Launch instance on ubuntu AMI image in AWS
connect to Control node
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install ansible

Step-2: Generate an SSH key 
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ls -lah ~/.ssh/    ###lists the ssh key files id_rsa, id_rsa.pub, authorised keys, known_hosts
cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys   ### print contents on authorized_keys file
### Manually echo the id_rsa.pub to authorised_keys_file on to the target nodes for paswword authentication

Step-3: Create an inventory file on Control Node
vim inventory
## Inside inventory file list app server and db server along with ssh keys 
[app_servers]
Private IP ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

[db_servers]
Private IP ansible_user=ubuntu ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa

[all:vars]
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3

Step-4: Write an Ansible Playbook to Install, Download, Extract and Start Apache Tomcat
vim deployment_ansible.yml
###Inside deployment_ansible playbook write the plays
- - -
- name: Install and Start Application Server (Tomcat)
  hosts: app_servers
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Java (Required for Tomcat)
      ansible.builtin.apt:
        name: openjdk-11-jdk
        state: present
      when: ansible_os_family == "Debian"

    - name: Ensure /opt/tomcat directory exists
      ansible.builtin.file:
        path: /opt/tomcat
        state: directory
        owner: ubuntu
        group: ubuntu
        mode: "0755"

    - name: Download and extract Tomcat
      ansible.builtin.unarchive:
        src: "https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.102/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.102.tar.gz"
        dest: /opt/tomcat
        remote_src: no
        extra_opts: [--strip-components=1]
        mode: "0755"

    - name: Start Tomcat server
      ansible.builtin.command: /opt/tomcat/bin/startup.sh
      args:
        chdir: /opt/tomcat
      async: 45
      poll: 0
Save and exit 

Step-5: Run the playbook
ansible-playbook -i ~/inventory tomcat_playbook.yml

Step-6: Connect to DB server  and install Mysql on it
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa ubuntu@Private IP
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install mysql-server -y
sudo systemctl start mysql
sudo systemctl enable mysql
systemctl status mysql

Step-7:  Check if MYSQL is running on DB server from Control Node
ansible db_servers -i ~/inventory -m shell -a "systemctl status mysql" -b
ansible db_servers -i ~/inventory -m shell -a "sudo netstat -tulnp | grep mysql" -b
ansible db_servers -i ~/inventory -m shell -a "mysql -u root -p" -b

Step-8: Check Tomcat is Running on Target Node
ps aux | grep tomcat
sudo systemctl status tomcat

Step-9: Find the Tomcat Port
sudo netstat -tulnp | grep java
Step-10: Access Tomcat in Browser
